# project-1-AniMeal

## Overview

Our application is an Anime database that allows the user to search an Anime from the title. The application then returns a description of the Anime and gives the user a random recipe in pair with the film. We often have known what Anime film we wanted to watch, however, we as a team rarely know what we want to eat. So we thought about creating an app that shows us what to eat while we watch our current favorite Anime.

Pur user story is as follows:
As a hungry anime fan // I want to be able to search anime and be suggested recipes to cook // So that I can cook something to eat while I watch anime

1. `git clone git@github.com:PDKetchum/project-1-AniMeal.git`
